I have been thinking of fireflies all week. Here is a very simple start to a firefly model. The firefly is a class that has three states. A firefly can be charging its light organs, have completely charged light organs, or be flashing. each firefly has varying charging time, flash disposition (how they are too flash once charged), and flash length. They do not yet react to each others flashes but there is still some interesting behavior. #processing4 #creativecode #p5js #lightningbug #firefly
