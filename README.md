# firefly
a place to hold some code for firefly models

I have been thinking of fireflies all week. Here is a very simple start to a firefly model. The firefly is a class that has three states. A firefly can be charging its light organs, have completely charged light organs, or be flashing. each firefly has varying charging time, flash disposition (how they are too flash once charged), and flash length. They do not yet react to each others flashes but there is still some interesting behavior. #processing4 #creativecode #p5js #lightningbug #firefly 


## firefli2

I have added another condition that will make fully charged fireflies flash if any neighbor is flashing.

I have had to add a second array like the game of life, so as not to overwrite the current array.

The fireflies are still have different charge times, flash dispositions and and flash lengths, but you can definitely see some syncing 

behavior and and it really looks more biological than random. if you do make all the fire flyies have the same charge times, flash dispositions and flash lengths 

the whole block quickly falls into a steady on off pattern.


The condition that has fully charged firefly flash when a neighbor flashes most impacts the firefly's flash disposition.

The fireflies do not have an internal clock other than their charge time and that is not affected by neighbors as it is in other models
